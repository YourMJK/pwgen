# pwgen
Swift CLI tool based on Apple's "Password AutoFill" generator code.

The original JavaScript code for Apple's "Password AutoFill" generator can be found at https://developer.apple.com/password-rules/, specifically in [scripts/generator.js](https://developer.apple.com/password-rules/scripts/generator.js) or [in this repository](_appleJS/js/generator.js).  
This tool can generate passwords in the same style ("more typeable" and uniformly random passwords) but with more customization options.

## Usage

```
USAGE:  pwgen [OPTIONS ...]

PASSWORD OPTIONS:
  -l <amount>       The minimum number of characters the password should be long. Always
                    matches actual length if "--random" and "--no-group" flags are both set.
                    (default: 18)
  -r, --random      Uniformly choose a random character for each position instead of generating
                    a "more typeable" password.
  -g, --no-group    Don't split password into more readable groups of characters by inserting
                    the separator character (dash by default) at equal intervals.
  -s <character>    The separator character used for splitting the password into groups.
                    Ignored when "--no-group" flag is set. (default: -)

GENERAL OPTIONS:
  -n <amount>       The number of passwords to generate. Each password will be printed in a new
                    line. (default: 1)
  --version         Show the version.
  -h, --help        Show help information.
```

## Build prerequisites

To build the package, the Swift toolchain version 5.7 or higher needs to be installed.  
- For macOS either [download Xcode from the AppStore](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835) or run `xcode-select --install` to just get the Command Line Tools. Swift 5.7 requires at least Xcode 14 and macOS 12.5 Monterey.
- For Linux [download Swift from swift.org](https://www.swift.org/download/) for your distro and follow the installation guide further down the page.

## How to build

- **Variant 1**:  
Run `make` to build the Swift Package.
- **Variant 2** (macOS only):  
Open the Xcode project and go to *Product > Build* (âŒ˜B).

After using one of these two variants to build the binary, you can either run it directly from `build/pwgen` or install it to your PATH location by running  
`make install`  
or by manually copying it, e.g.:  
`$ cp build/pwgen /usr/local/bin/`
